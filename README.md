## 🧱 Professional Background

Most of my past engineering work is part of internal company systems and covered under NDAs.  
However, my contributions include:

- Designing and maintaining workload automation pipelines  
- Building distributed job schedulers and backend services  
- Developing enterprise REST APIs for business-critical workflows  
- Modernizing legacy architectures into scalable .NET Core systems  
- Creating cross-platform mobile applications with real-time sync  
- Optimizing SQL-heavy systems and improving end-to-end performance  

While the original repositories are private, I am reconstructing selected tools, utilities, and architectures in **open-source form** to showcase my engineering style and thought process.
